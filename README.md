# Image Captioning using Deep Learning

This project implements an image captioning system using a deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The goal is to generate descriptive captions for a given image.

## Project Overview

The project uses a combination of a **pre-trained CNN** (InceptionV3 or ResNet) for image feature extraction and an **LSTM** model for caption generation. The model is trained on a dataset of images with corresponding captions (e.g., the MS COCO dataset).

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow (>=2.0)
3. Keras
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib
6. Pillow (for image loading)
7. Requests (to download datasets)

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

This project uses the **MS COCO dataset** for training. You can download the dataset using the script provided in `download_dataset.py`.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
   cd image-captioning
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the MS COCO dataset (you can download it manually or use the `download_dataset.py` script).

   ```bash
   python download_dataset.py
   ```

## How to Train

1. Preprocess the images and captions:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   This will start the training process. It may take some time depending on your hardware (GPU recommended).

## How to Generate Captions

Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate captions for new images:

```bash
python generate_caption.py --image_path <path_to_image>
```

## Example

```bash
python generate_caption.py --image_path example_image.jpg
```

The output will be the caption generated for the given image.
